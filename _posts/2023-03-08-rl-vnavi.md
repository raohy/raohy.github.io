# A survey on Visual Navigation for Artificial Agents with deep reinforcement learning

the paper divide rl algorithms into three categories: 
1.Value-based methods
2.Policy-based methods
3.Actor-critic methods. 

 and list four most used network/algorithms:
 1.deep Q-network
 2.Deep determinstic policy gradient
 3.Asynchronous advantage actor-critic(A3C)
 4.Proximal policy optimization

 5 visual navigation methods:
 1.direct drl vNavigation
  In detail, image depth information is conducive for theagent to avoid obstacles, and the closed-loop detection can beused for efficient exploration and spatial reasoning.
  
  A method is A3C with auxiliary tasks[59], but auxiliary task mainly depends on human selection. And then Zhu[63] fed the target images into actor-critic NN. In the area of path-planning, [69] proposed a differentiabe path planning method: value iteration network(VIN). [71] reconstructed VIN as arecursive convolutional network.
 2.hierarchical methods:
  To solve dimentional diaster, hierachical methods decomposes vnavigation into subproblems.
  1) Hierarchical abstract machines
