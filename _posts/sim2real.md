### Sim-to-Real Transfer in Deep ReinforcementLearning for Robotics: a Survey

background:
transfer learning and domain adaptation
knowledge distillation
mata reinforcement learning
robust rl and imitation learning

methods:
1.zero-shot transfer
build a realistic simulator as much as possible.
-system identification
    build a precise models of real worlds such as a simulator with more accuracy
-domain randomization 
    highly randomize the simulation(visual and dynamics randomization)

2.domain adaptation methods


application scenarios
1.dexterous robotic manipulation
2.robotic navigation


main challenges
In domain randomization, researchers tend to study empirically examining which randomization to add. For domain adaptation, some feature space can not be found.

future direction
1.integration methods
2.incremental complexity learning, continual learning and reward shaping.
